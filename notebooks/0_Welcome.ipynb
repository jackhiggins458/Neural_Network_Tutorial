    "Through this series of interactive tutorial sessions, we'll learn more about how neural networks work by coding one from the ground up. Before we get to that though, we'll first need to familiarise ourselves with Jupyter Notebooks and some programming fundamentals in the R programming language.\n",

    "# Session Outlines\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll be working through four sessions (with an optional fifth session). See below for an outline of what each session will involve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you're already comfortable and familiar with notebooks and/or R, just let us know and jump ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Session 1 üìö - Exploring Jupyter Notebooks](./1_Exploring_Notebooks.ipynb)\n",
    "- These sessions are designed to be experienced using Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "- To follow along and get the most out of the sessions, it'll help to know what Jupyter Notebooks are, what they can do, and how you can use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Session 2 üë©‚Äçüíª - Programming fundamentals in R](./2_Learning_R.ipynb)\n",
    "- To code up a neural network in Part 4, we'll need to equip ourselves with some fundamental programming skills.\n",
    "- In this session, we'll be using the programming language called R, which is commonly used for data analytics.\n",
    "- If you've coded using R or another language before, fantastic! Most of this session should feel quite familiar.\n",
    "- If you haven't, don't stress! There's a lot to take in, but we'll be there to help walk you through some fundamental programming concepts, including data types (particularly matrices and lists), variables, loops and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Session 3 üîé - Revising neural network concepts](./3_Revising_NNs.ipynb)\n",
    "- Before we get to coding, let's revise some of the machine learning and neural network basics covered in last week's presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Session 4 ‚úçüèæ - Coding a neural network](./4_Creating_NNs.ipynb)\n",
    "- Using only concepts and programming skills we've learned in the past couple of weeks, we'll design and code up a simple neural network model to classify handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Session 5 üöÄ - Where to from here?](./5_Discovering_More.ipynb)\n",
    "- If you're keen to learn more about anything we covered today, we've compiled a nice set of friendly resources, links and events to have a look at!\n",
    "- We'll be around to discuss any of these if you're interested.\n",
