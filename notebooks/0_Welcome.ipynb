    "Before that, we'll first need to familiarise ourselves with Jupyter Notebooks and some programming fundamentals in the R programming language.\n",

    "# Session Outlines\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working through four sessions (with an optional fifth session). See below for an outline of what each session will involve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you're already comfortable and familiar with notebooks and/or R, feel free to jump ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Session 1 üìö - Exploring Jupyter Notebooks](./1_Exploring_Notebooks.ipynb)\n",
    "- These tutorials are designed to be experienced using Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "- To get the most out of these tutorials, it'll help to know what Jupyter Notebooks are, what they can do, and how you can use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Session 2 üë©‚Äçüíª - Programming fundamentals in R](./2_Learning_R.ipynb)\n",
    "- To code up a neural network in Session 4, we'll need to equip ourselves with some fundamental programming skills.\n",
    "- In this session, we'll be using a programming language called R.\n",
    "- If you've coded using R or another language before, fantastic! Most of this session should feel quite familiar.\n",
    "- If you haven't, don't stress! There's a lot to take in, but we'll be there to help walk you through some fundamental programming concepts, including data types, variables, loops and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Session 3 üîé - Revising neural network concepts](./3_Revising_NNs.ipynb)\n",
    "- Before we start coding, we'll revise some of the machine learning and neural network basics covered in the presentation last week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Session 4 ‚úçüèæ - Coding a neural network](./4_Creating_NNs.ipynb)\n",
    "- Using only concepts and programming skills we've learned in the past couple of weeks, we'll design and code a simple neural network model to classify handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Session 5 üöÄ - Where to from here?](./5_Discovering_More.ipynb)\n",
    "- If you're keen to learn more, we've compiled a nice set of friendly resources, links and events to have a look at!\n",
    "- We'll also hang around to chat more if you have any questions.\n",
