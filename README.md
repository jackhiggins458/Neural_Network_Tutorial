# Introduction to Neural Networks Learning Session

---

Welcome! Click on the Binder button below to get started. It might take a while (a minute or so) to load up. If you run into any errors first time round, try one more time (Binder is a bit quirky sometimes).

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jackhiggins458/Neural_Network_Tutorial/HEAD?labpath=notebooks%2F0_Welcome.ipynb)

If you're having trouble getting the binder to load, you can read through the notebooks here on GitHub in the notebooks folder (although you won't be able to run the code).
